# Azure-Data-Engineering-On-Premise-SQL-Integration-Reporting

The **End-to-End Azure Data Engineering for On-Premise SQL Server Integration and Reporting** project is a comprehensive data engineering endeavor that aims to create a complete data platform using various Azure services. The primary goal of this project is to seamlessly ingest, transform, and load data from an on-premise SQL Server database into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, followed by data processing using Azure Databricks. The clean data is then loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics, and an interactive dashboard is built using Microsoft Power BI for effective reporting and visualization.

**Tools Used**:

**Azure Data Factory**: Used for orchestrating and automating data workflows, facilitating data ingestion from the on-premise SQL Server database to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

**Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**: Serves as the central repository for storing the ingested data in a scalable and cost-effective manner.

**Azure Databricks**: Utilized for data transformation, enabling the conversion of raw data into a refined and analyzable format.

**Azure Synapse Analytics**: Enables efficient data loading and acts as the analytical data warehouse for running complex queries and obtaining valuable insights.

**Azure Key Vault**: Ensures secure storage and management of sensitive information, such as encryption keys and authentication secrets.

**Azure Active Directory (AAD)**: Used for managing access and authentication to Azure resources, enhancing security and governance within the data platform.

**Microsoft Power BI**: Integrated with Azure Synapse Analytics to build an interactive dashboard, providing visualizations and reports for data analysis and business intelligence.

By successfully completing this project, I gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing end-to-end data engineering solutions in the Azure cloud environment. The project not only showcases my proficiency in utilizing various Azure services but also demonstrates my ability to handle data governance and security aspects by incorporating Azure Key Vault and Azure Active Directory. Additionally, the interactive dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI highlights my data visualization and reporting skills.
